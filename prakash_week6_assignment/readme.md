## 📝 Quick Overview

This assignment demonstrates:

- ✅ Secure data movement from local servers using **Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR)**  
- 📂 Integration of **FTP/SFTP data sources** into Azure Data Factory  
- 🔁 Building **incremental data pipelines** with **daily automation**  
- 📆 Configuring **monthly triggers** for the last Saturday of the month  
- 🔄 Implementing **retry logic** for transient failure recovery  

These components together form the foundation of reliable and scalable cloud-based data workflows in modern data engineering.
